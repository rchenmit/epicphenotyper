# Epic Phenotyper


[Computational Phenotyping](http://wwww.sunlab.org) is the fashion forward way to describe disease. The way physicians currently describe disease is inherently biased. 
A patient's physical state should not be described by ICD codes but rather by physiological signals, symptoms, demographics, and drug-drug interactions. 

You can find the source code for the pipeline at:
