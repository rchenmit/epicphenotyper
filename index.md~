# Marble Phenotyping Pipeline

The way physicians currently describe disease is inherently biased. 
A patient's physical state should not be described by ICD codes but 
rather by physiological signals, symptoms, demographics, and drug-drug interactions. 

## Algorithm

This is based on pattern/signal/subtype extraction strategies that leverage non-negative tensor factorization.

## Use Cases
Computational phenotyping was used in:

* heart failure subtyping
* epilepsy patient subtyping 
* stratification of cardiac patients undergoing cardiac MRI
